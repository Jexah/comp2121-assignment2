### COMP2121 Assignment 2 - P2PTwitter
  
---
 
> The goal of this project is to implement a basic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Twitter application. Like the original
Twitter application, the user is allowed to post a status message of at most 140 character. While
the original Twitter uses a centralised server (farm) to store the requests, your P2PTwitter program
will communicate with other P2PTwitter programs running remotely without using any centralised
server. Note that the subsequent tasks below only indicate the expected chronological progression;
only one solution that solves all tasks is expected to be submitted.
